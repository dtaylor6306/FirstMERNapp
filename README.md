# My first MERN app

## About the Project

I created a MERN app using react-express api style where the back end and front end are seperate. This was easier for me to understand and learn for my first app.

I hosted my front end on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and hosted my backend api on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

[My Website Hosted on Netlify](https://dtaylor6306-mernapi.netlify.app)


While the website may seem very simple, it was a very large project to take on from scratch with no prior experience(except one react app). When I started I didn't even understand the basics like get and post requests. I am proud of what I have learned and look forward to future projects!
## Features

This project allows you to create an account, and log in/log out. Log in is validated using the back end, passwords are hashed, and you can create students once logged in. This app saves cookies to check if you are logged in or not. This app also changes which items from the navigator are displayed based on log in status.
